# CLAUDE.md - docs-tui

## What is docs-tui?

Terminal documentation viewer for LevitateOS.

Built with a layered architecture:
- CLI/app orchestration
- domain filtering/policy
- React + Ink presentation
- text rendering pipeline

## What Belongs Here

- Docs UI behavior and navigation
- Docs slug guards and session flow
- Rendering pipeline for docs content blocks

## What Does NOT Belong Here

| Don't put here | Put it in |
|----------------|-----------|
| Documentation content | `docs/content/` |
| Website rendering | `docs/website/` |
| Generic terminal primitives | `shared/tui-kit/` |

## Key Rules

1. This app renders the full docs navigation tree from `@levitate/docs-content`.
2. Requested slugs must fail fast with explicit error when not in docs navigation.
3. No hidden fallbacks that bypass canonical docs navigation.
4. Keep generic runtime/UI primitives in `shared/tui-kit`.
