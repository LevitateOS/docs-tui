# Chrome Architecture

## Goal
Chrome (frames, seams, splits, intersections) is rendered from deterministic coordinates, not content layout or padding inference.

## Model
`@levitate/tui-kit` now exposes `src/chrome/*` with a grid/canvas renderer.

- Canvas: `ChromeGrid(width, height)`
- Each cell stores stroke connectivity (`N/E/S/W`) plus optional text overlay.
- Draw operations mutate connectivity, then a render pass resolves final glyphs.

## Glyph Sets
Theme line weight maps to a complete junction set:

- `single`: `┌ ┐ └ ┘ ─ │ ┬ ┴ ├ ┤ ┼`
- `bold`: `┏ ┓ ┗ ┛ ━ ┃ ┳ ┻ ┣ ┫ ╋`
- `double`: `╔ ╗ ╚ ╝ ═ ║ ╦ ╩ ╠ ╣ ╬`
- `round`: `╭ ╮ ╰ ╯ ─ │ ┬ ┴ ├ ┤ ┼`

No ASCII `-` fallback is used for structural chrome.

## Operations
Instruction layer (`ChromeLayer`) supports:

- `ChromeFrame` -> rectangle
- `ChromeSeam` -> horizontal structural seam
- `ChromeSplit` -> vertical structural split
- `ChromeRule` -> horizontal rule stroke
- `ChromeText` -> text overlay at absolute cell coordinates

Intersections are automatic because overlap is resolved from stroke masks.

## Composition Contract
`SurfacePane` now treats title chrome as frame-owned rows:

1. top border row
2. title row
3. seam row (`├…┤`)
4. content area below

Title seams are generated by chrome instructions, not by content separators.

## Install Viewer Mapping
`docs/tui` `InstallViewer` uses `SurfaceFrame` with titled left/right panes.
Both panes now receive structural title seams from the same `tui-kit` chrome path.

## Invariant
If a seam intersects a frame edge or split, the renderer emits the correct junction glyph mechanically (`├ ┤ ┼ ┬ ┴`) from coordinates.
